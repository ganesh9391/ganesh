<p>The Atlantic Ocean is the second-largest of the world's five oceans,
with an area of about 106,460,000 km². It covers approximately 20% of Earth's surface
and about 29% of its water surface area. The Atlantic Ocean occupies an elongated,
S-shaped basin extending longitudinally between Europe and Africa to the east,
and the Americas to the west. As one component of the interconnected World Ocean,
it is connected in the north to the Arctic Ocean, to the Pacific Ocean in the southwest,
the Indian Ocean in the southeast, and the Southern Ocean in the south.
The Atlantic Ocean is divided in two parts, by the Equatorial Counter Current,
with the North Atlantic Ocean and the South Atlantic Ocean split at about 8°N
