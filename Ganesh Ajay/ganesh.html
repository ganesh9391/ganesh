<p>Bumba is the creator god. He was a giant in form and white in color. This story describes the creation of the universe from nothing.

In the beginning, Bumba was alone, darkness and water covered all the earth.
It would happen that Bumba came to feel an intense pain in his stomach, and then Bumba vomited the sun, the moon, and stars.
The heat and light from the sun evaporated the water covering the earth, creating clouds, and after time, the dry hills emerged from the water.
Then Bumba vomited once more, bringing forth nine animals: the leopard, called Koy Bumba; the eagle, Ponga Bumba; the crocodile,
Ganda Bumba; the fish, Yo Bumba; the tortoise, Kono Bumba; a black leopard-like animal,
Nyanyi Bumba; a scarab; and a goat named Budi. Bumba also vomited many men; one of them was called Loko Yima and was white like Bumba.

These nine animals went on to create all the world's creatures. Three of Mbombo's sons then said they would finish creating the world.
The first to try, Nyonye Ngana, vomited white ants, but died after. To honor him, the ants went deep in the earth for dark soil
to bury him and transformed the barren sands at the earth's surface. The second, Chonganda, created the first plant,
which in turn gave rise to all trees, grasses and flowers. And Cheddi Bumba, the third son, made the last bird, the kite</p>
