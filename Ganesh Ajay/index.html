Earth sustains liquid surface water. About 71% of Earth's surface is made up of the ocean, 
dwarfing Earth's polar ice, lakes, and rivers. The remaining 29% of Earth's surface is land, consisting of

<p>A food chain explains which organism eats another organism in the environment. The food chain is a linear
 sequence of organisms where nutrients and energy is transferred from one organism to the other. This occurs when 
one organism consumes another organism. It begins with the producer organism, follows the chain and ends with 
the decomposer organism. After understanding the food chain, we realise how one organism is dependent upon another 
organism for survival.</p>
